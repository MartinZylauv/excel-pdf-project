# excel-pdf-project
Prototypes for an upcoming project i will be involved in. Testing with different libaries and functionality in C# as I've been used to coding in Java. A repository with the real project will be coming up as soon as the work begins on it. For now, this is just a "playground" of testing out the different libaries before i begin the real implementation.
